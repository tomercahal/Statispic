# Statispic
# Final cyber project 2020
Statispic is an app that let's you know which pictures are the best ones to upload to Instagram.
Using a machine learning model Statispic will let you know which images are the best!

For this project I used python for client and server, node.js for downloading the instagram photos for the dataset, MongoDB as my database and Unity for my GUI. 

I hope you like this project and if you have any suggestions please let me know!
